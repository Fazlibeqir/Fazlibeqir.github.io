  <h2>Electrolyte</h2>
  <hr>
  <p>We often hear about electrolytes, but what exactly are they and how do they affect our health?</p>
<p>Electrolytes are minerals that bind to body fluids, they activate electrical impulses. These include sodium, potassium, calcium, bicarbonate and magnesium, among other minerals.
    These minerals carry a small electrical charge in a liquid environment.
    Our body needs electrolytes to function. Essentially, electrolytes keep our cells, tissues, and fluids active and able to communicate within our body.
    They help our heart beat and relax, muscle movement and allow the nerves to carry out the transmission of impulses.</p>
<p>When can we have deficiency in the body?</p> <p>We usually lose electrolytes through sweat. Therefore, this is why athletes often take supplements.
    The kidneys tend to filter them, but this can have very little effect on our health.
    In addition to athletes, older people are particularly sensitive to electrolyte deficiency. People with kidney disease, diabetes and heart failure should also look for deficiencies.
    Although the dehydration caused by our summer activities is pronounced, we can be deficient at any time of the year.</p>
<p>Some of the main electrolytes are:</p>
<p>Sodium: Sodium controls the water content in our body. It is found mainly in our blood, plasma and lymphatic fluid.
    It maintains a balanced environment outside our cells, while potassium helps regulate the environment inside the cells.
    Sodium and potassium must be in sync to balance and maintain a healthy functional body.</p>
<p>Bicarbonate: Key to digestion, bicarbonate helps the body maintain a balanced pH.
    Bicarbonate acts as a regulator if the body becomes too acidic (for example lactic acid rises after a workout) or if it becomes too basic, from lack of acid.
    A balanced pH is necessary for our body to function properly.</p>
<p>Potassium: While sodium works outside the cells, potassium helps keep the parts that function inside the cells.
    It plays a key role in helping our cells absorb water.
    It is also essential for muscle and heart function and can help lower blood pressure.
    We lose potassium and sodium through sweat.</p>
<p>Calcium: Calcium is with the highest share of electrolytes in our body.
    Helps in the functioning of muscles and nerves, as well as blood clotting.
    If there is too little calcium in our blood, then our body will extract calcium from our bones.
    This can lead to osteoporosis if we do not pay attention to it.</p>
<p>Magnesium: This mineral is critical for nerve function, muscle development, regulating blood sugar and maintaining blood pressure.
    Muscle aches are often caused by a lack of magnesium</p>

    <h2>The spinal cord</h2>
    <hr>
    <p>The spinal cord consists of several irregularly shaped bones called rings.
        In children there are 33-34 but as they grow the lower rings stick out. An adult has 26 rings.
        Between the rings there are cartilage discs which give the spine elasticity for a great bend.
        In the middle of each ring there is a large hole where all the rings are connected through connective tissue,
        these holes together in their rings form a funnel in which the spinal cord is located.</p>
