  <h2>The Difference Between Epidemic, Endemic and Pandemic</h2>
  <hr>
  <p>Epidemic (from the Greek επιδημία - epi = above, over and demos = people) is the massive appearance of a disease within a living population and is not limited to any particular group of the population.
      In the most common cases are infectious diseases, but other diseases are not excluded, such as. in western countries overweight the human body is taken as an epidemic.
      The epidemic is limited in place and time with this is also distinguished from the Endemic. An epidemic is a higher degree of Endemicity that is talked about if 10% of a population is affected by any disease.
      In cases where the Epidemic crosses the borders of one country or spreads to several countries then the term Pandemic is used.
      The science that deals with the study of epidemics is Epidemiology and for animals Epizootia.</p>

  <h2>Rabies</h2>
  <hr>
  <p>Rabies is a viral disease that causes inflammation of the brain in humans and hot-blooded animals.
      Early symptoms may include fever and itching at the site of exposure.
      These symptoms are followed by one or more of the following symptoms: violent movements, uncontrolled convulsions,
      fear of water, inability to move body parts, confusion, and loss of consciousness. After the onset of symptoms,
      rabies almost always leads to death. The time period between contracting the disease and the onset of symptoms
      is usually from one to three months. However, this period can vary from less than a week to longer
      more than one year.The period depends on the distance the virus must travel to reach the central nervous system</p>
